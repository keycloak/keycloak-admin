# Keycloak Admin Console V2
This project is the next generation of the Keycloak Administration Console.  It is written with React and [PatternFly 4][1].

### Development Instructions

For development on this project you will need a running Keycloak server listening on port 8180.

1. Start keycloak
    * Download and run with one command
        ```bash
        $> ./start.js
        ```
    * or download Keycloak server from [keycloak downloads page][2] unpack and run it like:
        ```bash
        $> cd <unpacked download folder>/bin
        $> standalone -Djboss.socket.binding.port-offset=100
        ```
1. Go to the clients section of the existing Keycloak Admin Console and add the client
    * like this:
    ![realm settings](./realm-settings.png "Realm Settings")
    * or click on the "Select file" button and import `security-admin-console-v2.json`
    * or run `$> ./import.js`

1. Install dependencies and run:
    ```bash
    $> npm install
    $> npm run start
    ```

### Build and run through Docker
    git checkout git@github.com:keycloak/keycloak-admin-ui.git
    cd keycloak-admin-ui
    docker-compose build
    docker-compose up

You can reach the new admin interface at http://localhost

If your Keycloak instance is not on `localhost:8180`, create a file `.env` with the following:

    KEYCLOAK_ENDPOINT=https:\/\/remoteinstance.keycloak.com

### Additionally there are some nice scripts to format and lint

```bash
$> npm run lint
$> npm run check-types
```

To switch to a RH-SSO themed version of this console you can run:

```bash
$> npx grunt switch-rh-sso
```

To switch back just do a `git checkout public`

# Keycloak UI Test Suite in Cypress

This repository contains the UI tests for Keycloak developed with Cypress framework

## Run the test suite
### Prerequisites
* `Keycloak distribution` has to be [downloaded](https://www.keycloak.org/downloads) and started on 8081 port.  
**note**: the port in at the test suite side in [cypress.json](cypress.json) or at the Keycloak side, see [Keycloak Getting Started Guide](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/getting_started/#starting-the-keycloak-server),
* `npm package manager` has to be [downloaded](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and installed.

### via Cypress Test Runner

**By using `npx`:**

**note**: [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx) is included with `npm > v5.2` or can be installed separately.

```shell
npx cypress open
```

After a moment, the Cypress Test Runner will launch:
